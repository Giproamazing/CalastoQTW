    <h2> THE CIPHER </h2>
<p>Through the clouds we seek the light,</p>  
<p>A journey vast, through day and night.</p>  
In shadows deep, where doubts may blend,  
A truth to find, beyond the bend.

Mountains tall, valleys wide,  
With each step, our fears we hide.  
In skies so grey, our spirits mend,  
For in the clouds, our hope ascends.

Whispers soft, the winds may send,  
A message clear: you have failed this is not the end.  
Paths diverge, and hearts will bend,  
But know you missed something, my dear friend.

Stars will guide, the moon will lend,  
Its light so bright, to help defend.  
For in the clouds, our dreams extend,  
And in our hearts, we'll always mend.
